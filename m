We have but I think we use most of it for potential modules and the
fixmap but it is not that big. The increase in range from 1G to 3G is
just an example and a way to ensure PIE work as expected. The long
term goal is being able to put the kernel where we want in memory,
randomizing the position and the order of almost all memory sections.

That would be valuable against BTB attack [1] for example where
randomization on the low 32-bit is ineffective.

I didn't look into it. There is value in it depending on performance
impact. I think both PIE and lower grain randomization would be
useful.
