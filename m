But they are inlined on x86 :\

Yes, I was playing around with inventing some check like this without
the need for an annotation. It's not clear to me if it's going to work
or not yet, though :). Top two patches here are what I was playing
with:

Yeah, I guess I was wondering if there was some more clever location
in sparse itself we could move these to.
