The sparse warning is mistaken.  Or I'm mistaken.  But I suspect it's
the sparse warning.

The {0} syntax is covered by:

   [6.7.8.21] If there are fewer initializers in a brace-enclosed list
   than there are elements or members of an aggregate, or fewer
   characters in a string literal used to initialize an array of known
   size than there are elements in the array, the remainder of the
   aggregate shall be initialized implicitly the same as objects that
   have static storage duration.

So we're not assigning 0 to a pointer, or whatever sparse thinks we're
doing -- we're initializing every member of the struct with 0, which is
a good and safe way to initialize it.

Sparse folks, any comment?

Thanks,

- Chris.
