I understand little interest in sparse warnings among developers.

I see frequently patches related to fixing codebase such as:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/char-misc.git/commit/?h=char-misc-testing&id=324fa64cf4189094bc4df744a9e7214a1b81d845

Yes, I understand.

Maybe TRY_ACQUIRE() would fit such a situation:
https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html#try-acquire-bool-try-acquire-shared-bool

I will try with the easy ones in the beginning and share the analysis.


Thanks for your time!
