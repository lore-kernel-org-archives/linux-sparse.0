Yes, it's what's happening.

There are several more or less bad/good solutions, like:
* add raw_copy_{to,from}_user() in the list of checked function
  (not inlined in most archs).
* add a new annotation to force sparse to check the byte count
  (I'm thinking about __range__/OP_RANGE or something similar).
* do these checks before functions are inlined (but then some
  constant count could not yet be seen as constant).
* ...

Wasn't there some plan to remove all these __always_inline
because of the future 'asm inline'?
