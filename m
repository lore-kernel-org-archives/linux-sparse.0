I am not sure what is the best way to measure that.

I used the default configuration which uses frame-pointer. I built all
the different binaries with ORC and I see an improvement in size:

On latest revision (just built and ran performance tests this week):

With framepointer: PIE .text is 0.837324% than baseline

With ORC: PIE .text is 0.814224% than baseline

Comparing baselines only, ORC is -2.849832% than frame-pointers.

I agree but it might be hard to measure the exact impact. What is
acceptable and what is not?

That's aligned with what I see in the latest performance testing.
Performance is close enough that it is hard to get exact numbers (pie
is just a bit slower than baseline on hackench (~1%)).
