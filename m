Is the expectation then to have security functions also decrease size
and operational latency? Seems a bit unrealistic if so.
1-2% performance hit on systems which have become at least several
hundred % faster over recent years is not a significant performance
regression compared to the baseline before.
While nobody is saying that performance and size concerns are
irrelevant, the paradigm of leveraging single digit losses in
performance metrics as a reason to leave security functions out has
made Linux the equivalent of the broad side of the barn in security
terms.
If it has real-world benefit to the security posture of the system, it
should be a configurable option for users to decide if a percentage
point or two of op time is worth the mitigation/improvement provided
in security terms.

Separately, reading this thread i've noticed that people are using
different compiler versions in their efforts which makes any of these
sub 10% deltas moot - building a kernel with GCC4.9 vs 7.1 has more of
an impact, and not having all the same compiler flags available (like
the no PLT thing) flat out creates confusion. Shouldn't all of these
tests be executed on a standardized build config and toolchain?

Thanks,
