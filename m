I think we can leave the details about the [[]] notation out. IIUC,
it's only applicable to C++.

While this is in the correct format as the other attributes in this
file, I think this particular attribute is a special case, because of
the variety of fallbacks and differing support for them.  I'd like to
see in the commit message maybe a list of tools we'd like to support
and links to the feature requests/bug reports for them.  I acknowledge
it's more work to file bugs, but it's being a good open source
citizen, IMO.

I'm also curious which is the first version of GCC to support the
comment format?
