What are you talking about?  A GDT entry and the MSR do the same thing,
except that a GDT entry is limited to an offset of 0-0xffffffff (which
doesn't work for us, obviously.)

Why should the way compiler generates code affect the way we do things
in assembly?

That being said, the compiler now has support for generating this kind
of code explicitly via the __seg_gs pointer modifier.  That should let
us drop the __percpu_prefix and just use variables directly.  I suspect
we want to declare percpu variables as "volatile __seg_gs" to account
for the possibility of CPU switches.

Older compilers won't be able to work with this, of course, but I think
that it is acceptable for those older compilers to not be able to
support PIE.
