Okay, stupid question times:

 >>> -	struct mmc_request mrq = {0};

this is 'struct mmc_request mrq' and not 'struct mmc_request *mrq', right?

Then I think the sparse warning is correct.  From my experience, sparse 
is very clear: if any variable is defined as a pointer, you use NULL to 
reset the pointer instead of '0', and if any variable is a normal 
variable, you use '0' to reset the variable. I don't think sparse is 
smart enough to look at the underlying variables, which in this case, 
mrq contains members that are pointers to something.

in this case, the defined variable is not a pointer, rather a variable 
named mrq that is of type 'struct mmc_request'.  Therefore, 0 is correct 
to use and NULL is incorrect.

If you want it to be sparse-correct as well as human-readable correct, 
you probably should write the code that explicitly shows assigning each 
pointer member of mrq to NULL, ie:

struct mmc_request mrq;
mrq.sbc = NULL;
mrq.cmd = NULL;
mrq.data = NULL;
.
.
etc.
