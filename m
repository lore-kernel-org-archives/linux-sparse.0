Small update on that.

I noticed that not only we have the problem of gs:0x40 not being
accessible. The compiler will default to the fs register if
mcmodel=kernel is not set.

On the next patch set, I am going to add support for
-mstack-protector-guard=global so a global variable can be used
instead of the segment register. Similar approach than ARM/ARM64.

Following this patch, I will work with gcc and llvm to add
-mstack-protector-reg=<segment register> support similar to PowerPC.
This way we can have gs used even without mcmodel=kernel. Once that's
an option, I can setup the GDT as described in the previous email
(similar to RFG).

Let me know what you think about this approach.
