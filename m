A very approximate approach would be to look at each instruction using
the signed trick with a _32S relocation. All _32S relocations won't be
translated to more instructions because some are just relocating part
of an absolute mov which would be actually smaller if relative.

Used this command to get a relative estimate:

objdump -dr ./baseline/vmlinux | egrep -A 2 '\-0x[0-9a-f]{8}' | grep
_32S | wc -l

Got 6130 places, if you assume each add at least 7 bytes. It adds at
least 42910 bytes on the .text section. The text section is 78599
bytes bigger from baseline to PIE. That's at least 54% of the size
difference. Assuming we found all of them and we can't factor the
impact on using an additional register.

Similar approach with the switch table but a bit more complex:

1) Find all constructs as with an lea (%rip) followed by a jmp
instruction inside a function (typical unfolded switch case).
2) Remove occurrences of less than 4 for the destination address

Result: 480 switch cases in 49 functions. Each case take at least 9
bytes and the switch itself takes 16 bytes (assuming one per
function).

That's 5104 bytes for easy to identify switches (less than 7% of the increase).

I am certainly missing a lot of differences. I checked if the percpu
changes impacted the size and it doesn't (only 3 bytes added on PIE).

I also tried different ways to compare the .text section like size of
symbols or number of bytes on full disassembly but the results are
really off from the whole .text size so I am not sure if it is the
right way to go about it.
