While fuzzing shows that the kernel doesn't crash (and this is very
important), it does not show that it exhibits the expected behaviour,
and there could be a number of soft failures present.

e.g. certain functions might just return an error code if a pointer has
a tag other than 0xff (such that it looks like a kernel pointer) or 0x00
(such that it looks like a user pointer), and this might not result in a
fatal error even though the behaviour is not what we require.

Perhaps it's possible to compare the behaviour of a kernel making use of
tags with one which does not, though I'm not sure at which level the
comparison needs to be performed.

Thanks,
Mark.
