Please tolerate my misunderstanding here - but aren't the above two sta=
tements
contradictory ?
My understanding was the '0' or NULL would be assigned to the first mem=
ber of
struct mmc_request, which happens to be a pointer. Hence NULL is more c=
orrect
than '0', right ?

The type of the structure variable is irrelevant here. i.e.
struct mmc_request mrq =3D {0};
and
struct mmc_request *mrq =3D {0};

would generate the same warning, isn't it ?
