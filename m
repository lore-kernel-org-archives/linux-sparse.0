Hi,

Yeah.  I prefer {0}, because {} is a gcc-ism (the ANSI grammar demands
initializer-lists be non-empty) and is less readable for people who
haven't seen the idiom before and are wondering what's going on.

I'm still a little confused -- the {0} or memset(0, struct ..);
formations are used often in the kernel, even with pointers involved.
Is the warning (Wnon_pointer_null) run against the kernel by default,
or did Venkatraman add it manually?  If default, is it catching bugs?

Thanks,

- Chris.
