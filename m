The struct looks like this:
struct mmc_request {
        struct mmc_command      *sbc;           /* SET_BLOCK_COUNT for multiblock */
        struct mmc_command      *cmd;
        struct mmc_data         *data;
        struct mmc_command      *stop;

        struct completion       completion;
        void                    (*done)(struct mmc_request *);/* completion function */
};


So you assing '0' to sbc - which is a pointer.
So sparse warning is correct.
