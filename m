Note that the 8-10% hackbench or even a 2%-4% range would be 'huge' in terms of 
modern kernel performance. In many cases we are literally applying cycle level 
optimizations that are barely measurable. A 0.1% speedup in linear execution speed 
is already a big success.

Unfortunately mcmodel=large looks pretty heavy too AFAICS, at the machine 
instruction level.

Function calls look like this:

 -mcmodel=medium:

   757:   e8 98 ff ff ff          callq  6f4 <test_code>

 -mcmodel=large

   77b:   48 b8 10 f7 df ff ff    movabs $0xffffffffffdff710,%rax
   782:   ff ff ff 
   785:   48 8d 04 03             lea    (%rbx,%rax,1),%rax
   789:   ff d0                   callq  *%rax

And we'd do this for _EVERY_ function call in the kernel. That kind of crap is 
totally unacceptable.

How are these assumptions hardcoded by GCC? Most of the instructions should be 
relocatable straight away, as most call/jump/branch instructions are RIP-relative.

I.e. is there no GCC code generation mode where code can be placed anywhere in the 
canonical address space, yet call and jump distance is within 31 bits so that the 
generated code is fast?
