That's an understandable position, but I think it would also be
reasonable for sparse to special case using {0} as an
initializer.  {0} is a valid initializer for every type and so
it's sometimes used as an initializer for a local variable to get
the same effect that one would have for a static variable without
specifying an initializer.
