I built lkdtm with mcmodel=(kernel, small, medium & large).

Comparing the same instruction and its relocation in lkdtm
(lkdtm_register_cpoint).

On mcmodel=kernel:

     1b8:       48 c7 c7 00 00 00 00    mov    $0x0,%rdi
                        1bb: R_X86_64_32S       .rodata.str1.8+0x50

On mcmodel=small and mcmodel=medium:

     1b8:       bf 00 00 00 00          mov    $0x0,%edi
     1b9: R_X86_64_32        .rodata.str1.8+0x50

On mcmodel=large:

     235:       48 bf 00 00 00 00 00    movabs $0x0,%rdi
     23c:       00 00 00
                        237: R_X86_64_64        .rodata.str1.8+0x50

The kernel mcmodel extends the sign of the address. It assumes you are
in the top 2G of the address space. So the relocated pointer
0x8XXXXXXX becomes 0xFFFFFFFF8XXXXXXX.

The small and medium mcmodels assume the pointer is within the lower
part of the address space. The generate pointer has the 32-bit high
part to zero. You can only map the module between 0 and 0xFFFFFFFF.

The large mcmodel can handle a full 64-bit pointer.

That's why I use the large mcmodel on modules. I cannot use PIE due to
how the modules are linked.
