Hi,

Sorry, I've had few available time the last weeks.
I had look at them shortly after you send them but
I haven't yet made my mind about them.

I'm quite reluctant to add complexity (the AST walking)
if it doesn't bring much benefit if any.

In, short the problems are:
1) duplication of the AST walking
2) unreliable type because of using void *
3) unreliable size because array to pointer degeneracy

There is some solutions, though:
1) what *could* be done is to add a method 'check'
   to struct symbol_op and call it, *for example*,
   just after op->expand() in expand_symbol_call()
   (and add a mechanism to set this method for the symbol
   corresponding to copy_to_user()).

   Otherwise, splitting the AST walking from sparse.c
   and making it something generic would be preferable.

   Another approach could be keep the check via OP_CALL
   but doing it just after linearization, before the
   optimization destroy the types (and add, if needed,
   some flag to force linearize_cast() keep absolutely
   all type info).

2) this one seems pretty hopeless

3) the current calls degenerate()/create_pointer()
   do indeed destroy the original type and (at first sight)
   no 'addressof' should exist anymore after evaluation.
   This is inconsistent with the existence of expand_addressof().
   By changing degenerate()/create_pointer() the original
   type should stay available.

Sorry again for the late reply,
