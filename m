Note that 10% is the high-bound of a CPU intensive workload.

-model=small/medium assume you are on the low 32-bit. It generates
instructions where the virtual addresses have the high 32-bit to be
zero.

I am going to start doing performance testing on -mcmodel=large to see
if it is faster than -fPIE.

If mcmodel=small/medium was possible for kernel, I don't think it
would have less performance impact than mcmodel=large. It would still
need to set the high 32-bit to be a static value, only the relocation
would be a different size.
